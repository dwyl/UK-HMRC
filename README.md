#### To Note
The information here:

+ Assumes you have decided to register as **_self employed/sole trader_** and not as a company

## What?
This is an _incomplete guide_ to the things we think might be useful for you to know if you're working as a freelancer in the UK. It's mainly a record of **the questions we've been asked** on this topic.


## Why?
Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs ([HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs)) doesn't always make for the most
user-friendly experience. 

Instructions are often complicated or _conflicting_, especially as they have to cater to a large number of different situations.

Over the last few months [@nelsonci](github.com/nelsonic) and [@iteles](github.com/iteles) have fielded many questions along the lines of
'what do I need to do to be registered as self employed?' and 
'how do I know how much I need to set aside to pay tax?'.

***So this repo collects the answers to those FAQs*** so people can refer back to our answers.

## If you haven't already 
1. Register a self-employed with the HMRC: https://www.gov.uk/new-business-register-for-tax
  + For 2015/16 financial year, you **must do this by 1st October 2016**
  + This should get you both an online account with the HMRC ('Government Gateway account') **and** a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) - you'll need this to register for self-assessment
  + They will send you and activation code and a UTR **in the post**
  
## Things you'll need to pay & how to pay them
