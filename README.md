## What?
This is an _incomplete guide_ to the things we think might be useful for you to know if you're working as a freelancer in the UK. It's mainly a record of **the questions we've been asked** on this topic.



## Why?
Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs ([HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs)) doesn't always make for the most
user-friendly experience. 

Instructions are often complicated or _conflicting_, especially as they have to cater to a large number of different situations.

Over the last few months [@nelsonci](github.com/nelsonic) and [@iteles](github.com/iteles) have fielded many questions along the lines of
'what do I need to do to be registered as self employed?' and 
'how do I know how much I need to set aside to pay tax?'.

***So this repo collects the answers to those FAQs*** so people can refer back to our answers.
