# Frequently Asked HMRC Questions on being self employed in the UK

#### To Note
The information here:
+ Is specific to the United Kingdom
+ **Not exhaustive** and **may not be up to date** - please _check the date of the latest commits_!
+ Assumes you have decided to register as **_self employed/sole trader_** and not as a company
+ Assumes you are dealing with the 2015-16 financial year (April 2015 - April 2016) unless otherwise stated

## What?
This is an _incomplete guide_ to the things we think might be useful for you to know if you're working as a freelancer in the UK. It's mainly a record of **the questions we've been asked** on this topic.


## Why?
Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs ([HMRC](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs)) doesn't always make for the most
user-friendly experience. 

Instructions are often complicated or _conflicting_, especially as they have to cater to a large number of different situations.

Over the last few months [@nelsonci](github.com/nelsonic) and [@iteles](github.com/iteles) have fielded many questions along the lines of
'what do I need to do to be registered as self employed?' and 
'how do I know how much I need to set aside to pay tax?'.

***So this repo collects the answers to those FAQs*** so people can refer back to the answers when it comes time to fill in self assessments.

## What do I need to tell the HMRC and when?
1. Register a self-employed with the HMRC: https://www.gov.uk/new-business-register-for-tax
  + For 2015/16 financial year, you **must do this by 1st October 2016**
  + This should get you both an online account with the HMRC ('Government Gateway account') **and** a Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) - you'll need this to register for self-assessment
  + They will send you and activation code and a UTR **in the post**
+ Using your online account, register for self-assessment online

For the 2015/16 financial year, you must:
+ Fill in your **self-assessment** by **31st October 2016** (paper copy) or **31st January 2017** (online)

  
## What do I need to save up to pay?

There are 2 things you will need to pay annually:
+ Income tax
+ National insurance

These are both calculated once you fill in your **self assessment**.

For the 2015/16 financial year, you must:
+ **Pay** all tax and National Insurance (NI) by **31st January 2017**
  + This can be done online as soon as you've filled your self-assessment

### Income tax
+ Paid on _profits_ (revenue minus [allowable expenses](#allowable-expenses))
+ You have an income tax free allowance of **£10,600** for the 2015/16 financial year

## Asides

### Allowable Expenses
+ Here is the [HMRC's guide to allowable expenses](https://www.gov.uk/expenses-if-youre-self-employed/overview)
+ If you work from home for any part of the week, you can claim **a _portion_ of your _some_ living costs as business expenses** (electricity, rent and council tax for example)
  + Here is a [good guide from Freeagent on how to calculate your working from home expenses](http://www.freeagent.com/l/working-from-home-expenses-sole-traders) on how to work 
+ You can claim telephone calls as business expenses but if you also use your phone for _personal_ calls, you can only count the _business_ calls as business expenses

### VAT
You **do not need to register** for VAT until you reach **£82,000** of revenue in a given financial year.

### Helpful tips
+ Open a separate bank account _just_ for your business income and expenses - this will make things a lot easier to track (thanks [@jbarget](https://github.com/jbarget)!)
+ Open a separate savings account to save the money you will need to pay in income tax and national insurance throughout the year (thanks [@thegsi](https://github.com/thegsi)!)

### Notes
+ If you've also been in paid employment in this financial year, there is a section in your self-assessment form where you will need to include this information for it to provide you with the correct calculations
